ABOUT ME
Hello, my name is Batman Bin Suparman. Despite my name, I am not a superhero. Well, unless you count my absolute
unit of a mind that could create complex code in the blink of an eye. You see, when I was 10 years old, a truck filled with
uranium crash into me. Instead of dying, the uranium fused into my body resulting in my brain power to increase a
hundred fold. This newly found power enabled me to create any form of matter from the atoms suroundding me. I use
these powers to help companies in need of a software engineer to make the world a better place!

McDonaldâ€™s                      Fun fact: before your burgers are served, there are burger tasters to taste the quality of the
                                burger. What we would do is take a big bite of your burger, analyze the taste, and spit it back
                                out for your order.
