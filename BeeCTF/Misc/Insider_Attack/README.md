# Insider Attack

**Category** : Misc
**Points** : 500

Turns out one of our workers in BEEFEST Corps is a mole planted here from an enemy company. He has stolen confidential information from our headquarters and ran away with it.

He has erased every single information about himself from our database and all that's left is this CV. Looks like there's fake information in it but let's hope it can be useful for your investigation. Don't let him get away with this, track down his real name and where he could possibly be hiding!

Flag Format: BEECTF{Real_Name_PlusCode_CityName_CountryName} (e.g.) BEECTF{Clint_Eastwood_9G8F+5W_Zurich_Switzerland}
